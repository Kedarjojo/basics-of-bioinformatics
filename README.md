# basics-of-bioinformatics
Solving various problems that are the basics of coding in bioinformatics

### Problem 1(reverse_complement.py)}
Complementing a strand of DNA

### Problem 2 (GC_content.py)}
Finding GC content from a fasta file

### Problem 3 (Finding_Motif.py)}
Given two sequences, s and t, find all the instances of t being in s

### Problem 4 (hamming_distance.py)}
Finding hamming distance between two strings of same length

### Problem 5 (restriction_sites.py)
Given a DNA string, the program returns the position and length of every reverse palindrome in the string with a length between 4 and 12.

### Problem 6 (rabbits_fib.py)
Given positive integers n≤40 and k≤5, the program returns the total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).

### Script - map_human_genome_to_monkey.sh
This script facilitates the mapping of a section of the human genome to the single-cell sequenced adult monkey genome. It also performs downstream analysis on the resulting count matrix, providing insights into genomic similarities and differences.

### AI_llama
This project implements a pipeline for:

Extracting text from PDF files.
Generating embeddings using the Ollama API's "nomic-embed-text" model.
Performing semantic similarity search with FAISS.
Using the Ollama "mistral" model to generate context-aware responses.
This system is ideal for document analysis, enabling efficient querying and intelligent responses based on relevant documents.

### Handgrip_Calibration
This Shiny app streamlines the analysis of handgrip assessment data by enabling users to:

Upload handgrip data and log files.
Select parameters like site number and assessment type.
Generate calibration plots and download results.
With an intuitive workflow, the app ensures efficient data processing and visualization while providing a reference table for easy navigation and analysis.
