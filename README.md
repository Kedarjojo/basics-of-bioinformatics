# basics-of-bioinformatics
Solving various problems that are the basics of coding in bioinformatics

## Problem 1(reverse_complement.py)}
Complementing a strand of DNA

## Problem 2 (GC_content.py)}
Finding GC content from a fasta file

## Problem 3 (Finding_Motif.py)}
Given two sequences, s and t, find all the instances of t being in s

## Problem 4 (hamming_distance.py)}
Finding hamming distance between two strings of same length

## Problem 5 (restriction_sites.py)
Given a DNA string, the program returns the position and length of every reverse palindrome in the string with a length between 4 and 12.

## Problem 6 (rabbits_fib.py)
Given positive integers n≤40 and k≤5, the program returns the total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).
