However, it shows experiments on SIX1, SIX2, and SIX4, which are genes encoding members of the Sine oculis homeobox (SIX) family of transcription factors known to be involved in myogenesis (muscle development). The experiments suggest that changes in the expression levels of these SIX proteins can affect the expression of DUX4 targets.\n",

These could include chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to investigate whether the transcription factors bind to specific regulatory regions upstream of the DUX4 gene and if they activate its expression, as well as functional studies such as overexpression or knockdown of these factors in relevant cell types to assess their effect on DUX4 levels.\n"
